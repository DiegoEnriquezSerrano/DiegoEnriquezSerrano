## Welcome to my github!

I'm Diego and I love working on web technologies. I have primarily worked with Ruby (on Rails) and JavaScript, but nowadays I find myself knee-deep in Rust code most of the time.

I'm currently working on building an ActixWeb/SvelteKit newsletter application called newslt.rs
